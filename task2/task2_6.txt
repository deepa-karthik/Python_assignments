6) What is the output of the following code examples?

*x=123
 for i in x:
	print(i)

Output: will give an error as 'for' statement can be used only with iterables not with integers

* i=0
while i < 5:
	print(i)
	i += 1
	if i == 3:
	    break
	else:
	    print(“error”)

Output: 0
	error
	1
	error
	2
	error

* count=0
  while True:
     print(count)
     count += 1
     if count >= 5:
          Break

Output: 0
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5

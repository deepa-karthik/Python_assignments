4) How Tuple is beneficial as compared to the list?

* Tuple is an immutable datatype which does not give any provision to change the data present inside it.
While list is mutable which means the data inside a list can be easily modified or deleted.

* Iterating through a list is more time consuming than a tuple as lists are mutable. There are several chances through a proggram for a list to be modified. Hence the idexing has to be updated at every occasion.

*Lists require more memory allocation than tuples as they are mutable and are more prone to errors.
